### 2016-2022 US traffic accidents
This is a project I worked on with two other people, one of whom had to leave the project early. We were exploring a dataset about accident setting and effect on traffic flow. We split up the analysis in groups, one covering weather and the other on time. We analyzed 2.8 million out of 6.8 million accidents that occur in a year in the contiguous United States.
